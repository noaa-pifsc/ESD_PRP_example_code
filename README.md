## About the code
**PackagesInstalled.R:** Reinstalling all your packages when you update R is a 
pain.  This script addresses that.  Run it before the update to record which 
versions of which packages live where on your computer.  Run it after the update
to reinstall them.  

**LogbookAccess.Rmd:** Walks through the steps for accessing logbook data with R.
